extends Node3D

## Base for the weapons added after the first four (war hammer, sickle and dagger, morningstar,
## war axe, hatchets, hook, talons). Attach a script that extends this to a weapon node under
## MeleeWeapons (melee_weapons.tscn); the node's transform is still the weapon's idle pose.
## melee_weapons.gd registers every child with this script on its own (weapon_id + attack_data),
## runs the shared parts (equip, click buffer, windup -> strike -> recover, hit rays, hit-stop,
## combo rule, signals) and calls the hooks below for everything special. All hooks are optional.
## `weapons` is the MeleeWeapons node; behaviours use its public services (deliver_hit, start_attack,
## find_aimed_enemy, add_screen_shake, spawn_in_world, ...).

## How a press of attack is read for this weapon.
enum PressMode {
	## Attack on press (sword, halberd, crossbow).
	PRESS,
	## A quick click attacks; holding past hold_time starts the hold move (shield, hook, talons).
	CLICK_OR_HOLD,
	## Only the hold move; a click does nothing (war hammer).
	HOLD_ONLY,
	## A click attacks; holding only does something while empowered at S rank (sickle and dagger).
	HOLD_WHEN_EMPOWERED,
}

## False: the strike casts no hit rays (thrown weapons do their own hitting).
@export var uses_hit_rays: bool = true
## True: the click attack has an S-rank version, so at S it counts as empowered (glow sound,
## empowered_attack_started). False: clicks are always normal.
@export var empowered_click: bool = false
## Holding attack keeps attacking: a new click attack starts as soon as the weapon can attack again
## (only while no hold move is running or being waited for).
