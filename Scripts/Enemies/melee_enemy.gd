## Enemy that walks at the player and hits them.
## Builds on the training dummy, so damage, knockback, shield carry, crush and breaking all work the same.
## Behavior: stand idle until it notices the player, walk straight at them, and when close enough
## lean back (windup), lunge (strike) and rest (recover) before moving again.
## Getting hit or thrown staggers it for a moment and cancels an attack that hasn't landed yet.
## Pathfinding comes from the level: if a node in group level_navigation exists (the generated level),
## the enemy asks it which way to walk, so it follows corridors around corners. Without one it walks
## in a straight line and slides along whatever is in the way.
## This is also the base for every other enemy type: ranged ones set preferred_min_distance to
## hold their ground at range, attack_requires_line_of_sight, and override _strike() and the
## windup hooks (_on_windup_started, _on_windup_cancelled).
